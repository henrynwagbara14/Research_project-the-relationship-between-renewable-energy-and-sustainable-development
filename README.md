What is the relationship between renewable energy and sustainable development?

## Abstract

Climate change is one of the major environmental problems which we face as a society today. There natural causes for fluctuations of climate change, but humans have accelerated this more recently. As economic growth continues, it becomes increasingly important to mitigate the effects of climate change. Demand for goods and services rises in lockstep with population growth. While this is may be met, it has itâ€™s consequences on the environment in the form of pollution, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions . As a result, we must find a way to achieve sustainable development. In this regard, renewable energy (RE) resources appear to be the most efficient and effective solutions. This is the reason why there is a connection between RE and sustainability. RE sources are occupying a greater share the energy mix each year, showing that the transitional to a more sustainable future is imminent. This research uses econometric analysis to find the effects of RE, population and gross domestic product (GDP) on sustainable development within Europe. Results suggest that the effect of RE is not only negative, but the size of the effect is much greater in comparison to the other explanatory variables. It is believed that the conclusions and recommendations for this research will be useful to policymakers.
